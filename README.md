# Udacity-explore_bike_share_data
 This is my first project in the nano degree with udacity this project is for improve the skill in Python , Pandas, Numpy, I'v learn a lot from this experiment..
# Basic Data Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data

_Basic Udacity project using pandas library in Python for their bikeshare data exploration._

# Project Overview:

This project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. the code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. and  script that takes  raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Running the program:

You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Anaconda  in linux  terminal 
Distro : Ubuntu 20.04.LTS
 Also  run in command prompt  : windows .


### Program Details:

The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

* Most popular month

* Most popular day

* Most popular hour

* Most popular start station

* Most popular end station

* Most popular combination of start and end stations

* Total trip duration

* Average trip duration

* Types of users by number

* Types of users by gender (if available)

* The oldest user (if available)

* The youngest user (if available)

* The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.

# Requirements:

* Language: Python 3.8.8 or above

* Libraries: pandas, numpy, time

# Project Data:
 Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity , stored in the data folder.
* chicago.csv 
* new_york_city.csv -
* washington.csv
# Built with:

* [Python 3.8.8](https://www.python.org/) - The language used to develop the script.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) -the librarie used for the code.

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) -the librarie used for the code.

* [time](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html) - the librarie used for the code.
